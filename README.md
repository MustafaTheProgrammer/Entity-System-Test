# Entity-System-Test
Creates entities that can also update position. If you watch fast enough you'll see two objects, and both move to the right for a bit. I made this using a list with all the componetnts of the entities(e.g. ID, x, y), and then could access these components trhough loop traversals which can allow for things like rendering, position updating, ect.

I got lots of inspiration from a scratch project by the user playerdog. I was inspired by their method of using lists. The main difference is I used just 1, and they used several. I may also use several in the future so that access of elements is easier. playerdog's project mainly helped me understand how I'd like to update the position of the entities. Here's their project also: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414015527/
